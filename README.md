The Open Playback Recorder is an open-source device that can record three lists of voice messages that its user can playback via the trigger of an accessible button connected through a 3.5 mm mono jack. It aims to assist users with communication difficulties by giving them alternative methods to engage in conversation. This device has functionality similar to AbleNetâ€™s Big Mack or Step by Step. The device is comprised of off-the-shelf electronics and 3D printed parts. The overall cost of materials is about $80 (plus $8 for component shipping).
